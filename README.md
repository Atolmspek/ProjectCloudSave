This is a small, personal project for a personal library of videogames hosted on a web server.

It allows for completion dates, ratings, reviews, upload of files for games that don't have cloud save support (this was the main purpose of the app). It's made mostly with Java/Spring Boot. It needs to be hooked up to a local MySQL database to work.
